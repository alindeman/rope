*rope* is a pure Ruby implementation of the "Rope data structure":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_%28computer_science%29.

For many applications, the *Rope* class can be a drop-in replacement for *String* that is optimized for certain use cases.

Using a *Rope* instance over a *String* may be desirable in applications that manipulate large amounts of text.

*rope* currently offers:
* Fast string concatenation and substring operations involving large strings
* Immutability, which is desirable for functional programming techniques or multithreaded applications

Planned features for *rope*:
* Ability to view a function producing characters as a Rope (including I/O operations).  For instance, a piece of a Rope may be a 100MB file, but is only read when that section of the string is examined.  Concatenating to the end of that Rope does not involve reading the entire file.

Disadvantages of *rope*:
* Single character replacements are expensive
* Iterating character-by-character is slightly more expensive than in a String (TODO: how much? .. haven't implemented iterators yet)

h1. Installation

*rope* is hosted on "rubygems":http://www.rubygems.org/

<pre>
gem install rope
</pre>

... or in your Gemfile

<pre>
gem 'rope'
</pre>

h1. Usage

<pre>
rope = "123456789".to_rope # Rope::Rope.new("123456789") also works

puts rope # "123456789"
puts rope.slice(3, 4) # "4567"
</pre>
