*Rope* is a pure Ruby implementation of the "Rope data structure":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_%28computer_science%29

For many applications, *Rope* can be a drop-in replacement for the *String* class that is optimized for certain use cases.

Using a *Rope* instance over a *String* is desirable in applications that manipulate large amounts of text.

*Rope* currently offers:
* Fast string concatenation and substring operations involving large strings
* Immutability, which is desirable for functional programming techniques or multithreaded applicatoins

Planned features for *Rope*:
* Ability to view a function producing characters as a Rope (including I/O operations).  For instance, a piece of a Rope may be a 100MB file, but is only read when that section of the string is examined.  Concatenating to the end of that Rope does not involve reading the entire file.

Disadvantages of *Rope*:
* Single character replacements are expensive
* Iterating character-by-character is slightly more expensive than in a String (TODO: how much? .. haven't implemented iterators yet)
